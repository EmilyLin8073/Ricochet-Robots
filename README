#Ricochet-Robots
The object of the game is to get the designated numbered robot to the indicated letter position.                              
The numbered squares are all robots.  
They unfortunately have no brakes, and so will continue in whatever direction they are moving until they encountar an obstacle.                       
For each move enter the robot number and the desired direction.
For instance entering                                          
   1 U 
would move the #1 robot up as far as it can go.                
The first letter of input is the robot number (1 - 4),         
and the second letter is the direction:                        
  (L=left, U=up, R=right, D=down)                              
Enter x to exit.  Have fun!
